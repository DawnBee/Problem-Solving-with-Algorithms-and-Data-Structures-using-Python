# Problem-Solving-with-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-using-Python

I started the project by learning data structures and algorithms from a book *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python*.
It does not contain everything from the book, 
nor is everything implemented in the same way,
but it also contains other data structures, algorithms and problems.
